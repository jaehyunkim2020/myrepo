## Reading Notes

Use geom_freqpoly() instead of geom_histogram() when trying to overlay multiple histograms in the same plot. geom_freqpoly() performs the same calculation as geom_histogram(), but instead of displaying the counts with bars, uses lines instead. Itâ€™s much easier to understand overlapping lines than bars.

To suppress (#> Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_point).) warning, set na.rm = TRUE:

"ggplot(data = diamonds2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)"


## EDA Example

The code below is an example of the EDA process using the `starwars` data from the `tidyverse` package. (Make sure you have the `tidyverse` package installed!)

Run the code line-by-line and look at the output. Add a comment to each line of code that explains what it does/what insights it provides.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #uploads the tidyverse package

dim(starwars) #returns the dimension (e.g. the number of columns and rows) of a matrix, array or data frame.
colnames(starwars) #returns column names

head(starwars) #display first n rows present n the input data frame
glimpse(starwars) #gives a brief summary or a glimpse of the data

?starwars #description of the data background

starwars %>% count(species) #counts the amount of each species

mean(starwars$height) #calculates the average height from the data
mean(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE) #removed the data with NA instead of height numbers

summary(starwars$height) #gives a statistical summary of height

cm_to_ft <- function(cm){ #formula for converting cm to ft
  ft = cm / 30.48
  return(ft)
}

starwars_2 <- starwars %>% mutate(height_ft = cm_to_ft(height)) #added new column with height in ft

dim(starwars_2) #returns dimensions for the new starwars2 data
colnames(starwars_2) #returns column names for the new data

summary(starwars_2$height_ft) #statistical summary of the new added column

ggplot(starwars_2, aes(height_ft)) +  #creates a ggplot histogram for the height in ft column
  geom_histogram()

starwars_2 %>% filter(height_ft == max(height_ft))  #filtered out the highest height in ft 
starwars_2 %>% filter(height_ft == max(height_ft, na.rm = TRUE))  #removed data with NA in them

## EDA Practice

Continue exploring the `starwars` data to gain additional insights, using [R4DS: Chapter 7](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) as a guide.

It is ok if you don't understand the all code in Chapter 7. (That is what we'll be learning the next two weeks!) If writing your own code is a struggle, try the "copy, paste, and tweak" method.

```{r}
starwars_2 %>% 
  count(species, homeworld) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = homeworld)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```
